// I used the Two-Pointer Approach to efficiently sort an array of 0s and 1s in O(n) time complexity. By initializing start at index 0 and end at the last index, I moved start forward if it was already 0 and end backward if it was already 1, reducing unnecessary operations. When arr[start] > arr[end] (i.e., 1 before 0), I swapped them to maintain correct order. This ensured a single-pass solution, avoiding nested loops and making the approach optimal. My method is efficient, clean, and correctly sorts the array with minimal swaps. ðŸš€
