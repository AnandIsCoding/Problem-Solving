//      Design and implement a simple singly linked list using basic building blocks like nodes and references (or pointers). The goal is to:

//      Define a node with a value and a pointer to the next node.
//      Create individual nodes and link them together to form a list.
//      Traverse the list from the head and print each nodeâ€™s value.
//      This helps you understand how data is stored and accessed sequentially in memory using pointers or references.

//      Example:
//      Input: Create 3 nodes with values 10, 20, 30 and link them in order.

//      Output: Print values in sequence: 10 20 30
