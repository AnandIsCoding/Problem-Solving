// Largest Number After Digit Swaps by Parity
// Hard
// Given an integer, you need to return the largest integer possible by swapping even digits with even digits and odd digits with odd digits. You can only swap digits that share the same parity.
// Return the largest possible value of num after  any number of swaps.
// For example, for the number 2736, you can rearrange the digits to get the largest number 7632.

// Shallow copying is a method of copying objects where only the top-level properties are copied, but any nested objects are referenced, not copied. In other words,
//  if you make a change to a nested object in the copied object, it will also affect the original object, because they both reference the same nested object.
// Deep copying, on the other hand, is a method of copying objects where all properties, including nested objects, are copied to a new object. In this way, the original object and the copied object are completely separate, and changes made to one will not affect the other.

// Destructuring assignment is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and convenient way. It simplifies the 
// process of accessing and working with individual elements of an array or properties of an object.


// Spread syntax, often denoted by the three dots ..., is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to expand elements from one array, object,
//  or iterable into another. It provides a concise and convenient way to copy or combine data between arrays, objects, and other iterable structures. Spread syntax can be used in various contexts within JavaScript.
