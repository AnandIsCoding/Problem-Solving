**Explain the differences between Map and Set in JavaScript, and when would you choose one over the other?**
Map and Set are two distinct data structures in JavaScript, each with its unique characteristics and use cases.
**Map:**
Definition: Map is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and the keys can be of any data type.
Uniqueness: Each key in a Map must be unique. If you try to add a duplicate key, the value associated with the existing key will be overwritten.
Ordering: Maps maintain the insertion order of the keys, meaning the keys are stored in the order they were added.
Use Case: Maps are ideal for scenarios where you need to associate additional data or metadata with each element in a collection. For example, you can use a Map to store user information, where the key is the user ID, and the value is an object containing user details like name, email, and age.
**Set:**
Definition: Set is a data structure that stores unique values of any data type. It does not allow duplicate values, and the order of elements is based on the insertion order.
Uniqueness: Each value in a Set must be unique. If you try to add a duplicate value, it will be ignored, and the existing value will remain unchanged.
Ordering: Sets maintain the insertion order of elements, meaning the elements are stored in the order they were added.
Use Case: Sets are useful when you need to maintain a collection of unique values and perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference. For example, you can use a Set to store a list of unique tags associated with a blog post.

You should choose Map when you need to associate additional data or attributes with each element, and uniqueness is based on the keys. On the other hand, use Set when you want to store a collection of unique values and don't need to associate additional data with each element.
